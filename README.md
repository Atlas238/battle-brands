# Battle-Brands!
Battle-Brands is a collect-em-all style digital pet application in which a user can store and interact with different digital creatures, inspired by classic handheld games like the original digimon cubes. A user can sign up, creating a battle-brands account, after which they will be directed to their personal profile page and meet their first creature - a battle-brands pet! Once an account has been created a user can then link their Facebook and LinkedIn accounts to recieve the corresponding pet! For testing purposes we have included a myriad of other creatures a user can select from reputable tech brands.
